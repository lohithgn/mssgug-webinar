# Serverless Architecture - End to End Application Demo

As part of **Microsoft User Group Singapore (MSSGUG)**, I am presenting a webinar series titled "**Serverless Architecture - End to End Application Demo**". The webinar series is broken down into 4 parts. Idea was to showcase how to develop Serverless application in the real world keeping in mind the best practices. We are focusing on Azure Functions as the Serverless platform in this series. The 4 parts of the series are as below:

### **1. Part 1: Designing the API** 
You are part of an API develpoment team at Contoso Ltd. You have been asked to develop an API for the company. The API should be about managing ToDo's of Contoso Employees. How will you approach the problem? Will you design the API first? Will you dive right into Visual Studio and start coding the API as with any developer mind set? Whats the right way? How to get started?

In this part, we take a look at getting started with Designing the API. We understand what is Open API, Open API Initiative, Open API Specification, Swagger ecosystem and Auto Rest.

### **2. Part 2: DevOps for the API**
You have now finished designing your new API. You have generated the OpenAPI specification for your API. You have created the Azure Function HTTP Trigger based API using Auto Rest command line tool or Visual Studio Code. Now what's the next step ? Implementation of the API or build & deployment pipeline? Should you create your Infrastructure? Should you create your CI Pipeline? Should you create your CD Pipeline? Which way to go? In thispart of the webinar we take a look at DevOps side of the things for your API. We will be looking at Infrastructure as a Code with Pulumi as the Technology stack.

### **3. Part 3: Implementing the API**
API has been designed. We have infrastructure set up as code. We have our CI & CD pipelines ready. The only thing remaining is implementing the API. We are creating an Azure Functions based HTTP API - so whats the best practice to follow? Is there a best practice? How can be use Dependency Injection? In this part of the webinar we look at all the aspects of coding an API.

### **4. Part 4: Implementing Consumer**
By this time, we have our API developed & deployed using continuous integration & deployment technique. That means our API is ready to be consumed. This part of the webinar will focused on developing a simple web based consumer using Blazor WebAssembly. By choosing Blazor WebAssembly as of our technology stack for front end - our solution is now what we call as Fullstack .NET Solution.
